Here's a clearer and more professional version of your README content for the **Linear Regression** project:

---

# Linear Regression from Scratch

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Linear Regression** from scratch using Python and NumPy, with a focus on learning core ML concepts without relying on libraries like Scikit-learn.

## Features

* **Gradient Descent Optimization**
  Implemented using a high learning rate to explore its effects on convergence and performance.

* **R² Score as Objective Function**
  Instead of minimizing Mean Squared Error (MSE), the model optimizes the **R² (coefficient of determination)** score to directly assess goodness of fit.

* **Model Performance**

  * **Training R² Score:** 93%
  * **Testing R² Score:** 97%

* **Polynomial Regression**
  Extended the model to handle **non-linear relationships** by manually generating polynomial features.

## Highlights

* No external ML libraries used — built entirely from scratch.
* Demonstrates both **Linear** and **Polynomial Regression**.
* Great R² performance on test data indicates **generalization and robustness**.

## Future Improvements

* Include MSE and MAE as alternative error metrics.
* Add regularization (Ridge/Lasso) for better generalization on complex datasets.
* Visualize loss convergence and R² evolution over epochs.
